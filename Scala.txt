Scala - means scalable language
    runs on the JVM
    designed to grow with the demands of users, from writing small scripts
    everything is customizable to your program's requirements
    Object oriented AND functional programming
    Static typing
Flexible
    lets you add new types, collections, and control constructs
Convenient
    standard library has a set of predefined types, collections, etc.
Object oriented 
    every value is an Object
    every operation is a method call
Functional programming language
    - functions are first class values (just like integers and strings)
    - can pass them as arguments to other functions, return them from functions, store them in variables
    - Operations of a program should map input values to output values rather than change data in place
    - functions should not have side effects
Concise, High Level
Static Typing - advanced so that it reduces verbosity and adds language flexibility
Can be built on previously exisiting Java code
Has JVM and Javascript runtimes that let you build systems with access to huge libraries

println() - print line function

Immutable variables (val) - cannot be reassigned
    val fourHearts: Int = 4

Value types:
Double - default floating point value- more precise than float (15 decimal places)
Float - (7 decimal places)
Long
Int - 32 bit signed intger (-2 bil+, to 2 bil)
Short
Byte
Char
Boolean 
Unit

All of these are equivalent to Java primitive types (java.lang)

Most common for data related tasks:
Double, Int, Boolean, String
String is a sequence of chars

Mutalble variable (var):
var aceSpades: Int = 1

to reassign:
aceSpades = 11

Should use val whenever possible:
    data cannot be changed accidentally (defensive coding)
    easier to reason about
    Fewer unit tests to write
    More memtory required due to data copying (To change objects, you'll need to create a new object)

Also allows for type inference so we can do this:
val fourHearts = 4   

Exercises:
// Create a mutable variable for Alex as player A
var playerA: String = "Alex"

// Change the point value of A♦ from 1 to 11
aceDiamonds = 11

// Calculate hand value for J♣ and A♦
println(jackClubs + aceDiamonds)
