FIlling numbers with leading zeros - using REPLICATE and LEN
REPLICATE(string, integer)   - repeats a string a certain number of times
REPLICATE('0', 9 - LEN(registration_code))
SQL statement to concatenate with leading zeros:

SELECT  REPLICATE('0', 9 - LEN(registration_code)) + registration_code AS registration_code
FROM flight_statistics

OR if your SQL is newer than SQL Server 2012, use CONCAT:

SELECT CONCAT(REPLICATE('0', 9 - LEN(registration_code)) + registration_code AS registration_code)
FROM flight_statistics

OR you can use FORMAT function (since SQL Server 2012)

SELECT FORMAT(CAST(registration_code AS INT), '000000000') AS registration_code
FROM flight_statistics;

Exercises:

SELECT 
	-- Concat the strings
	CONCAT(
		carrier_code, 
		' - ', 
      	-- Replicate zeros
		REPLICATE('0', 9 - LEN(registration_code)), 
		registration_code, 
		', ', 
		airport_code)
	AS registration_code
FROM flight_statistics
-- Filter registers with more than 100 delays
WHERE delayed > 100

SELECT 
    -- Concat the strings
	CONCAT(
		carrier_code, 
		' - ', 
        -- Format the code
		FORMAT(CAST(registration_code AS INT), '0000000'),
		', ', 
		airport_code
	) AS registration_code
FROM flight_statistics
-- Filter registers with more than 100 delays
WHERE delayed > 100

Cleaning messy strings
Removing additional spaces using TRIM
Available since SQL Server 2017
TRIM removes any specified character from start and end of string
Removes space if we don't specify a character
SELECT code, TRIM(name) AS name FROM carriers

For older versions, you can use RTRIM(trailing spaces) and LTRIM(leading spaces)
Can combine

SELECT code LTRIM(RTRIM(name)) AS name FROM carriers

Unifying strings
If state is displayed differently, use Replicate
replaces all occurences of a specified string with another string
REPLACE(string_to_replace, occurences, string_replacement)
case insensitive by default
Problem: dataset has 'Florida', 'fl', and 'FL' for state

SELECT airport_code, airport_name, airport_city,
    REPLACE(airport_state, 'FL', 'Florida'),
    'Floridaorida', 'Florida') AS airport_state
FROM airports 
ORDER BY airport_state

OR you can use a case statement:
SELECT airport_code, airport_name, airport_city,
    CASE 
        WHEN airport_state <> 'Florida' THEN REPLACE(airport_state, 'FL', 'Florida')
        ELSE airport_state
    END AS airport_state
FROM airports 
ORDER BY airport_state

To replace with "FL" string (need REPLACE and UPPPER):
SELECT airport_code, airport_name, airport_city,
    UPPER(
        REPLACE(airport_state, 'Florida', 'FL')
     ) AS airport_state
FROM airports 
ORDER BY airport_state

Exercises:
SELECT 
	airport_code,
	-- Use the appropriate function to remove the extra spaces
    TRIM(airport_name) AS airport_name,
	airport_city,
    airport_state
-- Select the source table
FROM airports 

SELECT 
	airport_code,
	-- Use the appropriate function to remove the extra spaces
    LTRIM(RTRIM(airport_name)) AS airport_name,
	airport_city,
    airport_state
-- Select the source table
FROM airports 

SELECT 
	airport_code,
	airport_name,
    -- Use the appropriate function to unify the values
    REPLACE(airport_city, 'ch', 'Chicago') AS airport_city,
	airport_state
FROM airports  
WHERE airport_code IN ('ORD', 'MDW')

SELECT airport_code, airport_name, 
	-- Use the CASE statement
	CASE
    	-- Unify the values
		WHEN airport_city <> 'Chicago' THEN REPLACE(airport_city, 'ch', 'Chicago')
		ELSE airport_city 
	END AS airport_city,
    airport_state
FROM airports
WHERE airport_code IN ('ORD', 'MDW')

SELECT 
	airport_code, airport_name,
    	-- Convert to uppercase
    	UPPER(
            -- Replace 'Chicago' with 'ch'.
          	REPLACE(airport_city, 'Chicago', 'ch')
        ) AS airport_city,
    airport_state
FROM airports
WHERE airport_code IN ('ORD', 'MDW')

Comparing similarity between strings
SOUNDEX DIFFERENCE functions
SOUNDEX - phonetic algorithm - returns four character code to evaluate similarity between strings based on pronunciation
Exceptions - need to be careful because some words may return same code, but are different

SELECT DISTINCT A1.airport_state
FROM airports A1
INNER JOIN airports A2 
    ON SOUNDEX(A1.airport_state) = SOUNDEX(A2.airport_state)
    AND A1.airport_state <> A2.airport_state

this doesn't work correctly - only checks the first words, so we need to omit spaces:
SELECT DISTINCT A1.airport_state
FROM airports A1
INNER JOIN airports A2 
    ON SOUNDEX(REPLACE(A1.airport_state, ' ', '')) = SOUNDEX(REPLACE(A2.airport_state, ' ', ''))
    AND A1.airport_state <> A2.airport_state

DIFFERENCE
compares two SOUNDEX values and returns a value from 0 to 4
0 = little or no similarity
4 = high similarity

SELECT DISTINCT A1.airport_state
FROM airports A1
INNER JOIN airports A2 
    ON DIFFERENCE(REPLACE(A1.airport_state, ' ', ''), REPLACE(A2.airport_state, ' ', '')) = 4
    AND A1.airport_state <> A2.airport_state

SELECT 
    -- First name and surname of the statisticians
	DISTINCT S1.statistician_name, S1.statistician_surname
-- Join flight_statistics with itself
FROM flight_statistics S1 INNER JOIN flight_statistics S2 
	-- The SOUNDEX result of the first name and surname have to be the same
	ON SOUNDEX(S1.statistician_name) = SOUNDEX(S2.statistician_name) 
	AND SOUNDEX(S1.statistician_surname) = SOUNDEX(S2.statistician_surname) 
-- The texts of the first name or the texts of the surname have to be different
WHERE S1.statistician_name <> S2.statistician_name
	OR S1.statistician_surname <> S2.statistician_surname

SELECT 
    -- First name and surnames of the statisticians
	DISTINCT S1.statistician_name, S1.statistician_surname
-- Join flight_statistics with itself
FROM flight_statistics S1 INNER JOIN flight_statistics S2 
	-- The DIFFERENCE of the first name and surname has to be equals to 4
	ON DIFFERENCE(S1.statistician_name, S2.statistician_name) = 4
	AND DIFFERENCE(S1.statistician_surname, S2.statistician_surname) = 4
-- The texts of the first name or the texts of the surname have to be different
WHERE S1.statistician_name <> S2.statistician_name
	OR S1.statistician_surname <> S2.statistician_surname
